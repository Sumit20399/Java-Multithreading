/*
Traffic Light Controller (Java Solution)
Problem Statement:
You need to simulate a traffic light controller that lets cars from North-South and East-West directions pass alternately.

ðŸ’¡ Design
Two traffic lights: one for North-South (NS) and one for East-West (EW).
At any time, only one can be green.
Threads represent cars wanting to pass.
Use a shared lock or semaphore to alternate access.
